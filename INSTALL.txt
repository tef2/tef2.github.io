Note1: Please ensure that Biopython is installed
Note2: Please ensure that g++ is installed
Note3: Remove any previous installation of TEF2,
i.e. the 'tef_search' binary in ./src/

Run installation script as root or superuser: "python setup.py install"

The above command will:
- create the './src/tef_search' binary
- create a './build/' directory (which may be removed)

Once installed:
- run "chmod +x TEF2"
- access help with: "./TEF2 --help"


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Optionally:

1. Installation of NACCESS:
The optional accessibility-filter for the closed loop ends needs NACCESS to be
installed on your system: http://www.bioinf.manchester.ac.uk/naccess/

If NACCESS is installed in another directory than "/usr/local/naccess/",
change NACCESS_BIN_PATH in tef/tef.py accordingly, before installation of TEF2.

NACCESS needs a C-Shell (csh or tcsh):
install it via your Linux distribution, if necessary.


2. Installation of PyMOL:
pymol executable should be located in /usr/bin
If necessary, modify PYMOL_BIN in tef/tef.py before installation of TEF2.
