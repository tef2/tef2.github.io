Note1: Please ensure that Biopython is installed
Note2: Please ensure that g++ is installed
Note3: Remove any previous installation of TEF2, i.e. the 'tef_search' binary in ./src/

Run installation script as root or superuser: "python setup.py install"

The above command will:
- create the './src/tef_search' binary
- create a './build/' directory (which may be removed)

Once installed:
- run "chmod +x TEF2"
- access help with: "./TEF2 --help"
